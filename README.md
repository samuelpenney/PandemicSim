# PandemicSim

Created a simulator for a pandemic/epidemic, see over the course how I changed the project and made changes.

Currently working on a java version and will export for an easy to use version on any platform

Also java is faster than python

## How to Run the Simulation

### Running the Python Simulation

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
3. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Python files (e.g., `PandemicSimFinal.py`).
   - Run the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python PandemicSimFinal.py
     ```
4. **Follow the Prompts**: Enter the required inputs (e.g., number of people, locations, infection rate, and days) to start the simulation.

### Running the Java Simulation

1. **Install Java**: Ensure you have Java 8 or later installed on your computer. You can download it from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
2. **Compile the Java Program**:
   - Navigate to the `JavaProgram/EpidemicSim/src` directory.
   - Compile the `EpidemicSim.java` file using the following command:
     ```bash
     javac EpidemicSim.java
     ```
3. **Run the Java Program**:
   - After compilation, run the program using the following command:
     ```bash
     java EpidemicSim
     ```
4. **Follow the Prompts**: Enter the required inputs to start the simulation.

### Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the files.
- For Python, ensure the required libraries are installed before running the script.
- For Java, ensure the `javac` and `java` commands are available in your system's PATH.
